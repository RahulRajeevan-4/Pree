## Understanding Number Systems: The Secret Language of Computers
***
### 1. What is a Number System?
A number system is a method or language that defines how numbers are expressed using a set of symbols (digits) and rules. It tells us which digits are used and the value of each digit depending on its position.
**Example:**
The decimal system uses digits 0-9 and is what you use every day when counting money or measuring things.
***
### 2. Why Do We Need Number Systems?
Number systems help us count, measure, and store information in an organized way. Different systems are useful in different contexts — humans prefer decimal, while computers require binary.
**Example:**
You count apples with decimal numbers. But computers count using binary to match their hardware design.
***
### 3. What Language Do Computers Speak?
Computers understand only two states: ON or OFF, represented by 1 and 0. This is called the *binary number system*.
**Example:**
If you press a key or open a file, your computer converts that action into a string of 0s and 1s it can process.
***
### 4. How Does Binary Create EVERYTHING?
Binary sequences (strings of 0s and 1s) are used to represent all types of data: text, images, sounds, videos, and more.
**Example:**
An emoji :blush: is stored using a special binary code called Unicode. Videos are made of many images (frames), where each pixel color is stored as binary.

### 5. What Are the Types of Number Systems?
Here’s a quick breakdown:
| System        | What Is It?                                   | Digits Used           | Common Use            |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Decimal       | Humans' counting system                       | 0, 1, 2, ..., 9      | Daily life math       |
| Binary        | Computers’ language                           | 0, 1                 | Computer data         |
| Hexadecimal   | Shortcut to represent large binary numbers   | 0–9 and A–F (10–15)  | Programming, colors   |
| Octal         | Older computing system                        | 0–7                  | Early computers       |

#### a. Binary Number System (Base 2)
Uses only two digits, 0 and 1, representing OFF and ON states of computer switches. Each digit’s position has a value that is a power of 2.
**Example:**
Binary number 1101₂ means:
- $$1 \times 8$$ (2³) + $$1 \times 4$$ (2²) + $$0 \times 2$$ (2¹) + $$1 \times 1$$ (2⁰) = 13 decimal.
***
#### b. Decimal Number System (Base 10)
Most familiar system using digits 0 to 9. Each position represents a power of 10.
**Example:**
The number 347 means:
- $$3 \times 100$$ + $$4 \times 10$$ + $$7 \times 1$$ = 347.
***
#### c. Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16)
Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F to represent numbers 10-15. Each position is a power of 16, making it easier to read large binary numbers.
**Example:**
Hexadecimal 2F means:
- $$2 \times 16$$ + $$F$$ (15) = 47 decimal.
***
### 6. Why Don’t Computers Just Use Decimal?
Computers work with electronic switches that have only two states (ON or OFF). Decimal needs ten states per digit, which is complicated to build electronically.
**Example:**
Think of a light switch: it is either ON or OFF. You can’t have 10 different “positions” in a switch easily.
***
### 7. Where Do You See These Number Systems in Real Life?
Number systems are everywhere in technology, even if you don’t notice them.
**Examples:**
- **Colors on web pages:** #FF5733 uses hexadecimal.
- **IP addresses:** Like 172.16.254.1 (decimal visible to humans) is stored as binary inside the computer.
- **Videos and games:** All stored and processed as long binary sequences.
***
### Summary
- **Number systems** are languages to write numbers.
- **Binary** (0s and 1s) is what computers “speak.”
- **Decimal** (0-9) is what we use daily.
- **Hexadecimal** is a convenient bridge between humans and binary.
- Every digital thing you use relies on these systems working seamlessly together.

### Memory Trick
- Decimal = 10 fingers
- Binary = 2 toes (ON / OFF)
- Hexadecimal = Handy shortcut for big numbers
